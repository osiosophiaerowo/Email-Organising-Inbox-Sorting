# Email-Organising-Inbox-Sorting
Optimized a high-volume inbox of 7,900 messages, implementing a strategic labeling system to prioritize the most important records and reducing primary inbox congestion by 50%."

# Project: Inbox Architecture & Optimization

## **The Challenge**
The inbox had become difficult to navigate, with **7,868 emails** sitting in the primary view without categorization. This high-volume congestion made it challenging to distinguish mission-critical records—such as financial alerts, career opportunities, and academic updates—from general correspondence.

---

## **The Solution: Custom Labeling & Systematic Filtering**
I implemented a custom organization system designed to "fish out" high-priority information while maintaining the full history of all messages.

* **Primary Inbox Streamlining:** Successfully reduced the main Inbox view from **~7,900 down to 3,962** (a **50% reduction in congestion**) by redirecting specific categories into a structured filing system.
* **Mission-Critical Labeling System:** Developed five distinct "High-Value" zones to separate essential records from daily traffic:
    * **Bank (2,405 emails):** Consolidated all financial notifications and alerts.
    * **LinkedIn (5,240 emails):** Isolated career-related correspondence and professional networking updates.
    * **Crypto (1,573 emails):** Dedicated space for digital asset tracking and exchanges.
    * **Scholarship (664 emails):** Grouped educational opportunities for quick reference.
    * **Shopping (352 emails):** Organized receipts and order tracking
